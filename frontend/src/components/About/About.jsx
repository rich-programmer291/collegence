        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, We are team JDTS OG, the developer behind Collegence. As a student who
          has experienced the ups and downs of college life, I wanted to create
          a platform where students can find answers to their questions and
          receive advice from those who have already walked the path. My
          background in web development has enabled me to design and build this
          portal to serve as a bridge between students and their mentors.
